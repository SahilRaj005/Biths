# Birth Rate Analysis
This project analyzes birth rates using various data science techniques, including time series analysis, machine learning, and statistical testing. The goal is to uncover patterns in birth rates over time and assess trends using ARIMA and Prophet models.

# Features & Techniques Used

Data Cleaning: Handled missing values and converted dates to a structured format.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualized trends with Seaborn and Matplotlib.

# Time Series Analysis:

Seasonal decomposition to identify patterns in births over decades.

ARIMA model to predict future birth trends.

Prophet model for advanced time-series forecasting.

# Machine Learning:

Used a Random Forest Regressor to predict birth counts based on date-related features.

# Statistical Analysis:

Conducted a T-test to compare birth rates on weekends vs. weekdays.
